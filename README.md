# CSCE-813-Database

Authors: Casey Lafferty and Jianghao Wang

## Purpose

This database is designed to assist in the logistical management of the UNL Game Development Club, completed as an assignment for CSCE 813. The data used in this project is "semi-real" in that it uses real records (which majors are represented, real attendance records, etc) but does NOT use real user information in the members table. That information is replaced with fake data to protect member privacy.

## Database

The database tracks member information, email list, meeting attendance, and event attendance. The database is structured in a relational schema using MySQL. IDEs used in development include MySQL Workbench and Visual Studio Code.

## Visualization

The Visualization folder contains the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON files used in visualizing the data present in the database. Templates for the sites were gathered from ObservableHQ.com and bl.ocks.org and adapted to best show our data.
